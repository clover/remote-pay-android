# Clover SDK for Android PoS Integration

Current version: 1.3.1

## Overview

This SDK provides an API with which to allow your Android-based Point-of-Sale (POS) system to interface with a [Clover® Mini device](https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/mini). From the Mini, merchants can accept payments using: credit, debit, EMV contact and contactless (including Apple Pay), gift cards, EBT (electronic benefit transfer), and more. Learn more about integrations at [clover.com/integrations](https://www.clover.com/integrations).

The Android project includes both a connector and example. To effectively work with the project you'll need:
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org) (suggested version 3.4).
- An [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) (17+).
- An [IDE](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html), Android Studio works well .

To complete a transaction end to end, we recommend getting a [Clover Mini Dev Kit](http://cloverdevkit.com/collections/devkits/products/clover-mini-dev-kit).

For more developer documentation and information about the Semi-Integration program, please visit our [semi-integration developer documents](https://docs.clover.com/build/integration-overview-requirements/). 

## Release Notes
# Version 1.3.1
* Added support for Custom Activities
* Device status queries to determine the state of the device and payments processed by the device
  * ICloverConnector
    * Added
      * startCustomActivity - start a custom activity on the Clover device and receive a callback when it is done (onCustumActivityResponse)
      * sendMessageToActivity - send and receive messages to a custom activity running on the Clover device (onMessageFromActivity)
      * retrievePayment - query and receive the status of a payment on the device by its external id (onRetrievePaymentResponse)
      * retrieveDeviceStatus - query and receive the status of the device (onRetrieveDeviceStatusResponse)
  * ICloverConnectorListener
    * Added
      * onCustomActivityResponse
      * onMessageFromActivity
      * onRetrievePaymentResponse
      * onRetrieveDeviceStatusResponse
      
  * CustomActivity
    * apk must be approved and then installed via the Clover App Market
    * clover-cfp-sdk library
      * Added CloverCFPActivity that can be extended
      * Added constants for getting/retrieving activity payload CloverCFP interface
      * Working with Custom Activities...
        * The action of the activity, as defined in the AndroidManifest, should be passed in as part of the request
        * A single text payload can be passed in to the request and retrieved in the intent via com.clover.remote.cfp.CFPActivity.EXTRA_PAYLOAD constant. e.g. "com.clover.remote.terminal.remotecontrol.extra.EXTRA_PAYLOAD"
        * The CustomActivityResponse (onCustomActivityResponse) contains a single text payload, populated from the com.clover.remote.cfp.EXTRA_PAYLOAD extra in the result Intent
        * Block vs Non-Blocking Activities
            * A blocking CustomActivity (CustomActivityRequest.setNonBlocking(boolean)) will either need finish itself, or can be exited via ICloverConnector.resetDevice()
               * For example: Don't want a Sale request to interrupt Collect Customer Information Custom Activity
            * A non-blocking CustomActivity will finish when a new request is made
               * For example: Want a Sale request to interrupt showing Ads Custom Activity

  * ResetDevice now calls back to onResetDeviceResponse with the current status

# Version 1.2

* Renamed/Added/Removed a number of API operations and request/response objects to establish
  better consistency across platforms
  
  * ICloverConnector (Operations)
    * Added 
      * printImageFromURL
      * initializeConnection (REQUIRED) 
      * addCloverConnectorListener 
      * removeCloverConnectorListener
      * acceptPayment - (REQUIRED) Takes a payment object - possible response to a ConfirmPaymentRequest
      * rejectPayment - (REQUIRED) Takes a payment object and the challenge that was associated with
                        the rejection - possible response to a ConfirmPaymentRequest
      * retrievePendingPayments - retrieves a list of payments that were taken offline and are pending
                                  server submission/processing.
    * Renamed
      * capturePreAuth - formerly captureAuth
      * showDisplayOrder - formerly displayOrder - this is now the only operation needed 
        to display/change order information displayed on the mini
      * removeDisplayOrder - formerly displayOrderDelete
    * Removed 
      * displayOrderLineItemAdded - showDisplayOrder now handles this
      * displayOrderLineItemRemoved - showDisplayOrder now handles this
      * displayOrderDiscountAdded - showDisplayOrder now handles this
      * displayOrderDiscountRemoved - showDisplayOrder now handles this
    * Modified
      * SaleRequest, AuthRequest, PreAuthRequest and ManualRefund require ExternalId to be set. (REQUIRED)
        * ExternalId should be unique per transaction allowing the Clover device to detect, and potentially reject, if the same externalID is reused for subsequent transaction requests
      * changed all device action API calls to return void 
      * CloverConnecter now requires ApplicationId to be set via configuration/installation of the third party application. This is provided as part of the device configuration that is passed in during the creation of the CloverConnector.
      * Behavior change for RefundPaymentRequest. In the prior versions, a value of zero for the amount field would trigger a refund of the full payment amount. With the 1.0 version, passing zero in the amount field will trigger a validation failure. Use FullRefund:boolean to specify a full refund amount. NOTE: This will attempt to refund the original (full) payment amount, not the remaining amount, in a partial refund scenario.

      * onPrintRefundPaymentReceipt - if disablePrinting=true on the request, this will get called to indicate the POS can print this receipt
      * onRetrievePendingPaymentsResponse - called with the list of payments taken on the device that aren't processed on the server yet
    * Renamed
      * onDeviceDisconnected - formerly onDisconnected
      * onDeviceConnected - formerly on onConnected
      * onDeviceReady - formerly onReady

        challenge. 
      * RetrievePendingPaymentsResponse - Contains a list of PendingPaymentEntry objects,
                                          which have the paymentId and amount for each 
                                          payment that has yet to be sent to the server
                                          for processing.

      * PrintPaymentReceiptMessage - Contains the Order and Payment to be printed
      * PrintPaymentDeclineReceiptMessage - Contains the declined Payment and reason to be printed
      * PrintPaymentMerchantCopyReceiptMessage - Contains the payment to be printed
      * PrintRefundPaymentReceiptMessage - Contains Payment, Refund and Order
    * Renamed

        * Result:enum [SUCCESS|FAIL|CANCEL|ERROR|UNSUPPORTED] FAIL - failed to process with values/properties as-is CANCEL - canceled, retry could work ERROR - un expected exception occurred UNSUPPORTED - merchant config won't allow the request
        * Reason:String optional information about result value, if not SUCCESS
        * Message:String optional detail information about the result value, if not success
      * SaleResponse, AuthResponse and PreAuthResponse have 3 new flags (e.g. The payment gateway may force an AuthRequest to a SaleRequest)
      * IsSale:boolean - true if the payment is closed
      * IsAuth:boolean - true if the payment can be tip adjusted before closeout
      * IsPreAuth:boolean - true if the payment needs to be "captured" before closeout will close it
* voidPayment operation fix to verify connection status and check for void request
  acknowledgement from the Clover device prior to issuing a successful response
* Added DefaultCloverConnectorListener, which automatically accepts signature if a verify
  signature request is received
* Behavior change for RefundPaymentRequest - In the prior versions, a value of zero for 
  the amount field would trigger a refund of the full payment amount. With the 1.1 version, 
  passing zero in the amount field will trigger a validation failure. 
  Set fullRefund:boolean to `true` to specify a full refund. NOTE: This will attempt to refund 
  the original (full) payment amount, not the remaining amount, in a partial refund scenario.
* CloverConnecter now requires ApplicationId to be set via configuration of the 
  third party application. This is provided as part of the device configuration 
  that is passed in during the creation of the CloverConnector.  The String input parameter of
  "applicationId", which is passed in when instantiating the DefaultCloverDevice, should be 
  set using the format of <company specific package>:<version> e.g. com.clover.ExamplePOS:1.2
* Modified remote pay so prompts to take orders offline and flagging duplicate orders appear only in merchant facing mode.
* Added ability to query pending payments.
* PreAuthRequest - no longer prompts for signature, signature verification or receipt options on the customer facing device.
* Changes to support certain transaction level overrides have been included in this version. To facilitate the addition of the new override capabilities, some new options were added to the SaleRequest & TransactionRequest classes.
  * TransactionRequest - extended by SaleRequest, AuthRequest, PreAuthRequest & ManualRefundRequest
    * (Long) signatureThreshold was added to enable the override of the signature threshold in the Merchant settings for payments.
    * (DataEntryLocation) signatureEntryLocation was added to enable the override of the Signature Entry Location in the Merchant Signature Settings for Payments.  Value of NONE will cause the device to skip requesting a signature for the specified transaction.
    Possible values:
      * ON_SCREEN
      * ON_PAPER
      * NONE
    * (Boolean) disableReceiptSelection was added to enable bypassing the customer-facing receipt selection screen.
    * (Boolean) disableDuplicateChecking was added to enable bypassing any duplicate transaction logic and associated requests for confirmation.
    * (Boolean) autoAcceptPaymentConfirmations was added to enable the automatic acceptance of any payment confirmations that might be applicable for the given transaction (e.g. offline payment confirmation).  This override prevents any payment confirmation requests from being transmitted back to the calling program and continues processing as if a confirmPayment() was initiated by the caller.
    * (Boolean) autoAcceptSignature was added to enable the automatic acceptance of a signature (on screen or on paper) if applicable for the given transaction.  This override prevents signature confirmation requests from being transmitted back to the calling program and continues processing as if a acceptSignature() was initiated by the caller.
  * SaleRequest (extends TransactionRequest)
    * (TipMode) tipMode was added to specify the location from which to accept the tip.  You can now provide a tip up front or specify no tip to override the merchant configured (on screen/on paper) settings. **NOTE** If you desire to take the tip on paper, populate the signatureEntryLocation with ON_PAPER
    Possible values:
      * TIP_PROVIDED - tip is included in the request
      * ON_SCREEN_BEFORE_PAYMENT - valid when requested via Mini or Mobile
      * NO_TIP - tip will not be requested for this payment

## Getting Connected
1. Download the USB Pay Display app from the Clover App Market on your Clover Mini Dev Kit.
2. Open the USB Pay Display app
3. Run the Clover Connector Android Example POS app on your Android POS device (emulator, device etc.)
4. You should see the example POS screen and connection state listed. If everything worked you'll get a connected status. If it remains disconnected, you'll want to check that 1) You are connecting the correct cable to the correct connection point on the Clover Mini “hub” - port USB(port with Clover logo). You will need to use the USB cable that the device came with. 2) That your Android devices support “host” or OTG mode, which is required to communicate with the mini, which will operate in “accessory” mode.
  
## Working with the SDK
    
  ```
      ICloverConnect cloverConnector = new CloverConnector(new USBCloverDeviceConfiguration(getContext(), "com.yourcompany.app:2.1.1"));
      cloverConnector.addCloverConnectorListener(new DefaultCloverConnectorListener() {
          public void onSaleResponse(SaleResponse response) {
             if(response.isSuccess()) {
                // do something with response.getPayment()
             } else {
                // failure processing
                // look at response.getResult() to see the reason for the failure
             }
          }
          
          public void onConfirmPaymentRequest(ConfirmPaymentRequest request) {
              // will be called if needed by the device to
              // confirm a payment. e.g. offline, duplicate check, etc.
              boolean acceptPayment = false; // prompt user, config, etc.
              if(acceptPayment) {
                  cloverConnector.acceptPayment(request.getPayment());
              } else {
                  cloverConnector.rejectPayment(request.getPayment());
              }
          }
          
          // wait until this gets called to indicate the device
          // is ready to communicate
          public void onDeviceReady(MerchantInfo merchantInfo) {
              super.onDeviceReady(merchantInfo);
          }
      }
  
      cloverConnector.initializeConnection();
      ...
      // after the connector is ready
      if(cloverConnector.isReady()) {
          SaleRequest saleRequest = new SaleRequest(2215, "b1234"); // $22.15 with externalID "b1234"
          cloverConnector.sale(saleRequest);
      }
